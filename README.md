<summary><strong>üîß Generating SMBIOS</strong></summary>
  <br>

- ### Generating SMBIOS:

Used [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) from corpnewt, to generate a fake serial number, UUID and MLB.

**This step is mandatory to get the device booting and get iServices to work later on**
1. Download GenSMBIOS from the link above as .ZIP, then extract it.
2. Start GenSMBIOS and select option `1` to download and install MacSerial
3. Select option `3` and enter `iMac18,1`
4. **IMPORTANT:** reminder that you need an **invalid serial!** to check copy and paste the second part saying `Serial: XXXXX..` in [Apple's Check Coverage Page](https://checkcoverage.apple.com/), if you get a red message saying "We're sorry, we're unable to check coverage for this serial number."
 then, you're good to go! Otherwise, go back and restart from step `2` (more info [here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#serial-number-validity))
5. once you get the right serial number you can go and fill the generated data in the config.plist file under `PlatformInfo` section, and you are good to go!
